            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THough You know I am not inclin'd to Scribling, and therefore can expect no Packet from me, yet being ſenſible of your want of freſh Intelligence of News from <hi>Dublin;</hi> and I being oblig'd to ſhew my gratitude for the laſt Favours you did me, do readily lay hold on this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of telling you ſomewhat Remarkable has happen'd within the compaſs of theſe five days I have been in <hi>Dublin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt, when the Lord Lieutenant, Nobility, and Gentry were return'd from <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> where they had been Celebrating the King's Coronation: according to the cuſtome upon State Feaſtivals, the Great Guns on the <hi>Cuſtome-Houſe Key</hi> were diſcharg'd; the firſt of which (being either over charg'd, or through age, or ill uſage, become faulty) burſt into ſeveral pieces, which flew divers ways, and fell at conſiderable diſtances; particularly one piece of neer an hundred weight, flew into the Houſe of Captain <hi>Lovet,</hi> on the <hi>Blind Key,</hi> and did much miſchief; ſeveral perſons were hurt (as 'tis ſaid) by other pieces: but one piece hit a Gentleman on the ſide of his head, who was leaning on a poſt hard by, with intention to have fired one of the Guns himſlf; which Gentleman (Clerk he was to the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Bleſſinton</hi>'s Troop)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:171076:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>was taken up, carried home, dreſſed by Chirurgeons, died yeſterday, and was buried this afternoon.</p>
            <p>This Account is purely Tragical: But another that I am to give you, may be ſaid to be Tragi-Comical; for it has Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and Battery to the higheſt degree, in it, yet is the Tidings of it very welcome, I obſerve, to all here, and will be no leſs to you, though at ſo conſiderable diſtance. 'Tis the Relation was this day brought, of the Surprize, and Killing of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Northern Tory, Count <hi>Hanlan:</hi> The circumſtances whereof, as I received them from the mouth of one of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſederates, and Executioner, and Mr. <hi>William Lucas,</hi> who was Commiſſioned in that affair. That His Grace, the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant finding all ways and endeavours hitherto uſed, as well by Himſelf, as other Chief Governours, for repreſſing and bringing to condign puniſhment, outragious Rebels and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, infeſting this Kingdom; reſolved to act by his own ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and way: which was to this effect. His Grace ſent for a Perſon of Honour of this City, (acquainted in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties theſe Tories chiefly reſorted to,) and commanded him to find ſome perſon of choice, who might be capable of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Service in that Affair. On which Command of His Grace, Mr. <hi>Williaw Lucas</hi> of <hi>Drumintyan</hi> in the County of <hi>Down</hi> was ſent for; who received the following Commiſſion, writ every word with His Grace's own hand, for privacy. None knowing of the deſign but this Perſon of Honour, and Mr. <hi>Lucas,</hi> whom His Grace acquainted with it. Beſides other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate directions given Mr. <hi>Lucas</hi> by His Grace, which I could not obtain. But the Commiſſion is as follows.</p>
